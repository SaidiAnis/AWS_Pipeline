# AWS_Pipeline
# AWS Data Pipeline Project

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of an end-to-end data pipeline in AWS, utilizing services like **S3**, **Glue**, **Lambda**, **Step Functions**, and **SNS** for automating the data flow. The objective is to showcase how to build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable data pipeline in the cloud using best practices for data management and processing.

The pipeline processes large datasets, automates transformation tasks, and stores the results in an AWS data warehouse for further analysis.

## Services Used
- **AWS S3** for storing raw data and processed results.
- **AWS Glue** for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless execution of processing functions.
- **AWS Step Functions** for orchestration of different pipeline steps.
- **AWS SNS** for notification in case of success or failure.
- **AWS IAM** for managing permissions securely.

## Pipeline Overview

This AWS-based data pipeline automates the following process:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data (CSV files) are uploaded into an **S3 bucket**.
2. **Data Transformation**: 
    - **AWS Glue** jobs clean, transform, and prepare the data for storage. 
    - The transformation includes removing invalid entries, formatting data, and applying necessary business logic.
3. **Orchestration**:
    - **AWS Step Functions** is used to coordinate the sequence of operations (upload to S3, trigger Glue jobs, etc.).
    - **AWS Lambda** functions are triggered for specific tasks, such as data validation and notification.
4. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in an **S3 bucket** and can be loaded into a data warehouse (e.g., **Amazon Redshift**) for further analysis.
5. **Notification**: **AWS SNS** is used to send notifications regarding the success or failure of the pipeline process.

## Requirements

- **AWS Account**: Required for configuring the services (S3, Glue, Lambda, etc.).
- **AWS CLI**: Make sure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with your credentials.
- **Python 3.x**: For running Lambda functions and Glue jobs.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python (used to interact with AWS services in Lambda functions).

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-data-pipeline.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd aws-data-pipeline

### Step 2: Set up AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with your AWS credentials.

1. Install the AWS CLI if you haven't already.
2. Run the following command to configure your AWS access key, secret key, and default region:
   aws configure

### Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket for Raw Data

Create an S3 bucket where the raw data will be uploaded.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the **S3** service and create a new bucket to store your raw data.
3. Set up the necessary permissions to allow uploading and accessing the data.

### Step 4: Upload Raw Data

Upload your dataset to the S3 bucket you created.

1. Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to upload your raw data (CSV, JSON, etc.) into the **raw-data** directory in your bucket.
2. To upload using the CLI, use the following command:
   aws s3 cp path/to/your/data.csv s3://your-bucket-name/raw-data/

### Step 5: Set Up AWS Glue Job

1. Go to the **AWS Glue Console**.
2. Create a new Glue job for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
   - Select your source data (S3 bucket).
   - Configure the transformation logic (cleaning, filtering, etc.) and set up the target (another S3 bucket, Redshift, or a database).
3. Ensure the job is triggered automatically once data is uploaded to S3.

### Step 6: Set Up AWS Step Functions

1. Go to the **AWS Step Functions Console**.
2. Create a new state machine that orchestrates the following actions:
   - Trigger the Glue job once the data is uploaded to S3.
   - Add Lambda functions or other tasks if needed (e.g., for data validation or notifications).
3. Set up the Step Functions workflow to run in sequence when a new file is uploaded.

### Step 7: Monitor the Pipeline

1. Use **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor the logs for Glue jobs, Lambda functions, and Step Functions.
2. Set up **SNS** notifications to alert you on the success or failure of the pipeline.

### Step 8: Store Processed Data

Once the transformation is complete, the processed data will be stored in the target location (S3 bucket, Redshift, etc.). You can then use this data for further analysis or reporting.
